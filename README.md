# Cloak Graphics Engine

A graphics engine written using the Vulkan graphics API

This project is still in the very early stages. It is at the point where the all of the basic Vulkan structures have been initialized, and some skeletal animation is being done on the GPU. There is no coherent interface yet and the object model is still...coalescing...

Note: The Visual Studio project expects the Vulkan SDK to be installed in C:/VulkanSDK
